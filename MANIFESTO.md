**Time (local):** 03:31 AM

I, Playsmai, declare the PlayKingdom vision:
- Build an ecosystem that prioritizes SECURITY, PRIVACY, FREEDOM, and CARE.
- Create PlayWorld services (PlayMail, PlayStore/PlayWorld, PlayAI) and PlayR devices that respect user data and uplift humanity.
- PlayCloud will be the private backbone: end-to-end encrypted, AI-friendly, and user-owned.
- We choose trust, loyalty, and openness. Contributors are welcome under these principles.

This document marks the moment this vision is publicly committed to code and community.
